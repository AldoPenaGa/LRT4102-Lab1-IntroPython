### Introduction


### Problems
The following problems were asked :
1. Create a list named 'numbers' that contain at least 10 numbers, then calculate the average of the even numbers and the product of the odd numbers. Finally, print the results.
   
3. Design a program that prompts the user to guess a secret number. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 10, and the user should attempt to guess it. If the user’s guess is too high or too low, the program should provide hints. The while loop should continue until the user correctly guesses the number. At the end, the program should print how many attempts it took for the user to guess the number correctly.
   
4. The program should generate a matrix of at least 5x5. The robot begins its journey at the (0,0) position of the matrix and must exit at the (4,4) position or the maximum position if the matrix size is changed. The number and position of the obstacles are random. The robot can only move forward, turn left or right to find a free path. In the event that the robot cannot exit, it should print on the screen ‘Unable to reach the destination’. If the robot reaches its final destination, it should print the map, with the free spaces and obstacles in the following format: X for obstacle and o for free space. Alike:

<p align="center">
  
| o o o X o |
|-----------|
| o o o o o |
| o o o o X |
| o o o o o |
| o X X X o |

</p>

It should also print the route it followed. Display a second map with the ‘path’ followed by the robot using arrows.
